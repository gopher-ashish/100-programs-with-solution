66. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with
    their name.
66. Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are
    greeted with their names.
67. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the
    numbers 1 to n
68. Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are
    considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
69. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the
    possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the
    product of 1,…,n.
70. Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
71. Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming
    language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to
    the largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)
72. Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After
    every guess, the program tells the user whether their number was too large
    or too small. At the end, the number of tries needed should be printed. It
    counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times
    consecutively.
73. Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.
74. Write a function that reverses a list, preferably in place.
75. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.
76. Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.
77. Write a function that computes the running total of a list.
78. Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
79. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a
    for-loop, a while-loop and recursion. (Subject to availability of these
    constructs in your language of choice.)
80. Write a function on_all that applies a function to every element of a list. Use
    it to print the first twenty perfect squares. The perfect squares can be found
    by multiplying each natural number with itself. The first few perfect squares
    are 1*1= 1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9, 4*4=16. Twelve, for example, is not a perfect
    square because there is no natural number m so that m*m=12. (This
    question is tricky if your programming
    language makes it difficult to pass functions as arguments.)
81. Write a function that concatenates two lists. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]
82. Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements,
    e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3].
83. Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list.
    [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]. You can do this quicker than concatenating
    them followed by a sort.
84. Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. Try solving this without creating a
    copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?
85. Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.
    The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The n+1-st Fibonacci number
    can be computed by adding the n-th and the n-1-th Fibonacci number. The
    first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8.
86. Write a function that takes a number and returns a list of its digits. So for
    2342 it should return [2,3,4,2].
87. Write functions that add, subtract, and multiply two numbers in their digit-list
    representation (and return a new digit list). If you’re ambitious you can
    implement Karatsuba multiplication. Try different bases. What is the best
    base if you care about speed? If you couldn’t completely solve the prime
    number exercise above due to the lack of large numbers in your language,
    you can now use your own library for this task.
88. Write a function that takes a list of numbers, a starting base b1 and a target
    base b2 and interprets the list as a number in base b1 and converts it into a
    number in base b2 (in the form of a list-of-digits). So for example [2,1,0] in
    base 3 gets converted to base 10 as [2,1].
89. Implement the following sorting algorithms: Selection sort, Insertion sort,
    Merge sort, Quicksort, Stooge Sort. Check Wikipedia for descriptions.
    Implement binary search.
90. Write a function that translates a text to Pig Latin and back. English is
    translated to Pig Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to
    the end of the word and adding ‘ay’. “The quick brown fox” becomes “Hetay
    uickqay rownbay oxfay”.
91. Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.
    Intermediate Level
92. Write a program that takes the duration of a year (in fractional days) for an
    imaginary planet as input and produces a leap-year rule that minimizes the
    difference to the planet’s solar year.
93. Implement a data structure for graphs that allows modification (insertion,
    deletion). It should be possible to store values at edges and nodes. It might
    be easiest to use a dictionary of (node, edge list) to do this.
94. Write a function that generates a DOT representation of a graph.
95. Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse code and
    vice versa.
96. Implement a binary heap. Once using a list as the base data structure and
    once by implementing a pointer-linked binary tree. Use it for implementing
    heap-sort.
97. Implement an unbalanced binary search tree.
98. Implement a balanced binary search tree of your choice. 
99. Impliment sorting algorithms
